Utilize AWS CloudWatch metrics, VPC Flow Logs, and network monitoring tools to identify and resolve issues promptly, ensuring minimal impact on system availability and performance. Collaborate with cross-functional teams to implement corrective actions, conduct root cause analysis, and document resolutions for knowledge sharing and continuous improvement.
• Automate network deployment and management processes using Terraform and GitOps practices, integrating with CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or GitHub Actions.
• Create reusable Terraform modules and templates for network deployments, ensuring consistency, scalability, and maintainability of infrastructure code.
• Provide general support for AWS services and infrastructure, including troubleshooting issues, responding to incidents, and assisting with system administration tasks such as user management, access controls, and permissions management.
• Provide support for infrastructure-related issues, troubleshoot Terraform configurations, and implement solutions to improve infrastructure reliability, security, and performance.
• Ensuring that the organization's cloud infrastructure is secure and compliant with relevant regulations and standards. This can involve implementing security measures such as firewalls and encryption, and monitoring for potential security threats.

About Us:

Welcome to the exciting world of Homebase in Monterrey, Mexico! We are looking for passionate individuals like you to join our unstoppable team of developers. Can you imagine being one of the first members of this adventure?

Our mission is to make hourly work easier for local businesses and hourly workers. Homebase currently serves more than 100,000 small (but mighty) businesses with everything they need to manage their hourly teams: employee scheduling, time clocks, payroll, team communication, hiring, onboarding, and compliance. Just don’t call us “Human Capital Management.” We have built tools for the busiest businesses, so owners and employees can spend less time on bullsh*t and more time on what matters. The Homebase team brings small business expertise from Intuit, Square, OpenTable, Yelp, Gusto, and First Data. Homebase is backed by leading venture investors Bain Capital Ventures, Baseline Ventures, Cowboy Ventures, Khosla Ventures, Plus Capital, and GGV Capital.

Concerned about working in a fully remote company? Don't worry, we have big plans for you! Our goal is to create a hybrid team that will work together two days a week in the San Pedro area of Monterrey. Just imagine the opportunities to learn and grow, both personally and professionally, while collaborating with exceptional colleagues in an inspiring space.

So, if you're ready to join an exciting adventure and make an impact in the world of technology, now is the perfect time to become part of our team in Monterrey! Apply today and be a part of the future we are building together at Homebase!
